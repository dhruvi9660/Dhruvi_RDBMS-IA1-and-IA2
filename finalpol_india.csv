13-11-2018,The Quint," Tulsi Gabbard, the first Hindu lawmaker from Hawaii in the US Congress, is considering a run for American presidency in 2020, according to sources close to her. On Friday, 9 November, at a Medtronic conference in Los Angeles, eminent Indian-American Dr Sampat Shivangi introduced Gabbard, 37, and said that she could be the next president of the US in 2020. The brief statement was marked by a standing ovation, in the presence of the four-term Congresswoman from the 50th US State. Gabbard, a Democrat, didnâ€™t confirm that she would be running for president in 2020, but she didnâ€™t deny it either. Tulsi Gabbard is an American politician of the Democratic Party serving as the US Representative for Hawaii's 2nd congressional district since 2013. Gabbard, who represents a constituency in Hawaii, is not of Indian descent and neither of her parents are Hindu, but she practises Hinduism. Gabbard was born in 1981 in Leloaloa, American Samoa, the fourth of five children born to Carol and Mike Gabbard, a State Senator. In 2002, Gabbard became the youngest person ever to be elected to the Hawaii State Legislative, and in 2012, she was elected to the US House. She went on to win the general election by nearly 80 points. She is one of the first female combat veterans to serve in Congress, and she was deployed with the Hawaii National Guard to Iraq in 2005 and Kuwait in 2009. According to a report in , Gabbard became one of the most popular political figures after she broke with the Democratic Party establishment and endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders instead of Hillary Clinton in 2016, even resigning as the vice chair of the Democratic National Committee in order to be able to do so. In 2004, Gabbard volunteered to join the 29 Brigade of US soldiers when they were called to war in Iraq. According to Gabbardâ€™s website, â€œShe (Gabbard) felt it was more important to stand in solidarity with her fellow soldiers than to climb the political ladder.â€ However, Gabbardâ€™s critics have questioned her views on foreign policy and her tolerance of dictators like Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad. Gabbard came under attack after she met Assad in 2017. Speaking to CNNâ€™s Jake Trapper, she said that she hadnâ€™t planned on meeting him but when the opportunity arose, she did, because she felt it was important. Democratic leaders maintained silence on one of their leaders meeting a head of state who has been dubbed a war criminal by the US. Then, in April 2017, Gabbardâ€™s stand on the chemical attack in Syria raised eyebrows again. According to an article in  , in 2015, Gabbard was among the Democrats who voted for restrictions on refugees entering the US from Syria and Iraq. She had also expressed â€œskepticismâ€ about the widely held assertion that Assadâ€™s government was behind chemical attacks in Syria. After the 2002 Gujarat riots, the US government had denied a visa to Narendra Modi, who was the chief minister of Gujarat at the time. Gabbard was one of the few to criticise the US governmentâ€™s decision. According to an article in  , five months after Narendra Modi was elected prime minister of India, Gabbard opposed a resolution which called for â€œreligious freedom and related human rights to be included in the United States-India Strategic Dialogue and for such issues to be raised directly with federal and state Indian government officials,â€ saying that it would weaken India-US relations. In August 2014, Gabbard made it a point to meet Modi in New York after his Madison Square Garden speech and presented him a copy of the  that she swore by when she was elected. Before that, in August 2014, speaking at a fundraising event for the BJP in Georgia, US, Gabbard had hailed Modiâ€™s 2014 landslide victory and said, â€œPeople (of India) stood up, one by one by one by one, and said â€˜we will demand that this change occursâ€™.â€ (What does the first-time woman voter want?

03-07-2018,Pushpesh Pant,"proud to announce Swami Vivekananda ranks among the highest in the pantheon of distinguished children of Mother India. His charismatic personality electrified audiences, and his organisational skills were unmatched. His influence on other freedom fighters â€“ from Yogi Aurobindo to Netaji Subhas C Bose â€“ is just as incomparable. It was not only fellow Indians who came under Vivekanandaâ€™s spell. He was arguably the first and most successful brand ambassador of a resurgent India in the USA, spreading his teaching far and wide. Vivekananda strove to combat superstition, to get rid of the deadwood of ritual that wasÂ  stifling those who followed the Hindu way of life, and left behind a large body of written work, reinterpreting the Vedanta for modern times. Vivekanandaâ€™s ways were unorthodox. The cigar-smoking monk had no problem with those who ate meat. He freely borrowed from whatever he felt was the best practice in other religions. His favourite word was â€˜strengthâ€™ â€“ he exhorted fellow Indians to be strong in body and spirit. He was compassionate and liberal in his outlook. For him, there was no religion greater than serving the wretched â€“ the poor, the ailing, and the oppressed. The ochre robes of a Hindu monk have become a red rag for these scholars who bore the heavy  . Vivekananda became a symbol of what was termed   strident and aggressive. They failed to see that Vivekananda continued to mesmerise the young and old across the length and breadth of India, long after his death. Calendar art bears testimony to this â€“ the undisputed Trimurti of Swami Vivekananda, Shaheed Bhagat Singh and Netaji Subhash Bose continue to adorn the walls of many homes even today. Those who are agitated today about the appropriation of Vivekananda by the Sangh Parivar and are desperate to reclaim him, must ask themselves this question â€“ why and how had they remained blind to the multifaceted contributions of this exceptional Indian? Today the Congress and other parties in opposition are desperately trying to get a foothold in the hearts and minds of voters who proudly proclaim their adherence to â€˜Sanatana Dharmaâ€™. Simultaneously, strategists are working overtime on how best to market â€˜Soft Hinduismâ€™ to counter the machinations of the Hindutva Brigade. In the short term, this opportunism may bring some dividends, but it is bound to eventually boomerang. The  believed in service before self, and couldnâ€™t stand hypocrisy. He examined the past with ruthless detachment and tested everything with razor-sharp intelligence. He was indeed a pioneering moderniser. At the same time, one can not surgically separate the social reformer from the spiritual seeker. Like Adi Shankaracharya, whose life and outlook Vivekananda seemed to have mirrored in many ways â€“ the disciple of the mystic Ramkrishna  had something to offer to each person. Swami Vivekananda preached not only   (selfless action) but also emphasized the ethos of   and   (devotion and intellectual quest). This apart, Vivekananda had an impish sense of humour, and would have surely been very amused by the bickering among his blind followers, and detractors. It would be foolish to suggest or believe that he can be owned and monopolised by any partisan / sectarian group. Indians and foreigners alike will continue to be enriched by his teachings, and Vivekananda will remain a living presence above political skirmishes. Therefore, apprehensions about the misappropriation of Vivekananda are totally misplaced. One doesnâ€™t even have to be a believer â€“ far less a Hindu â€“ to admire Vivekananda, and acknowledge his seminal contribution to the making of modern India.

18-07-2018,Meeran Chadha Borwankar,"In the news for the wrong reasons, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) of late has been attracting public attention for the misdemeanor of it past directors, and more recently, due to the alleged discord between its director and special director that has culminated into Alok Verma tendering his resignation after much political and legal hullabaloo.  It is extremely unfortunate for the bureau, as it hosts officers of impeccable integrity. They would indeed feel disturbed and so would the citizens who frequently demand CBI investigation in complicated, sensitive and controversial crimes. Criminal cases against its former directors â€“ Ranjit Sinha and AP Singh â€“ to say nothing of the unceremonious transfer of its past Special Director Rupak Dutta, tipped to be the director in 2017 â€“ are some of the recent instances that have cast a shadow over the bureau. But more so, on the procedure followed for selecting the top boss of the agency. In the process, merit is relegated to the back burner, as was in the case of the untimely transfer of Rupak Dutta to â€˜accommodateâ€™ the current incumbent Alok Verma, and the controversial induction/promotion of the Special Director Rakesh Asthana. The high-powered panel for the selection of the director of the CBI has as three members ie the Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition, and the Chief Justice of India. Yet, two of its past directors have been tainted â€“ they have been accused in criminal cases. It is thus a poignant comment on the selection procedure, and a travesty of the highest order. The CBI comes under the Department of Personnel and Training (DOPT), thus directly under the Prime Ministerâ€™s Office (PMO). It has a presence in most states in the country. The Bureau has also been notified as the Interpol of India for the purpose of liaison with police organisations of other countries, and to facilitate cooperation in international cases. There are two types of officers in the CBI â€“ directly recruited officer investigators / support staff, and investigators and supervisors inducted on deputation from outside. The leadership lies with the Indian Police Service (IPS), with officers selected from all over the country. The CBI does not have a policy like the Intelligence Bureau (IB) or Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), wherein the officers on deputation can get permanently absorbed. At any given time, there are about 20 percent and above vacancies, for various reasons like state police officers being unwilling to come on deputation etc. As per the CBI manual, the superintendent and above have specified powers for registration of cases, and the CBI follows it scrupulously. An officer of a particular rank can register an economic offence of a particular magnitude at his / her level, and to go above that, they need the permission of the rank above them. Similar guidelines on the basis of ranks exist for registering offences under Prevention of Corruption Act. There are legal advisers at each stage of investigation, and a follow-up of cases in courts is quite good. However, on occasion, the quality of its investigation and prosecution have been criticised by the courts as in the 2G spectrum allocation case recently. At other times, the courts have come down heavily on the CBIâ€™s decisions, with the Supreme Court terming it as â€˜caged parrotâ€™ and â€˜His masterâ€™s voiceâ€™. The internal vigilance wing has often nabbed some of its corrupt officers and prosecutors, proving that the CBI has its own black sheep. The pendency of cases however is mounting, despite special courts designated to handle CBI cases. These are issues of serious concern. In most cases, the investigation is of high standard, and the investigating officers are encouraged to pursue the collection of scientific evidence. The conviction rate is higher in CBI cases, as the investigating officers do not have to handle other departments like law and order / security/ VIP duties. They devote their full time to investigation. When I joined the Bureau in 1999, I was impressed by the depth of discussion and focus on investigation. I also found that the investigating officers took much longer to complete an investigation â€“ some in the hope that more cases would not come their way if they go slow on the earlier ones! But by and large, the work culture and environment had been highly professional. During the '90s, the Bureau was given more resources, and the millennium saw special allowances â€“ 25 percent of the pay for ranks up to the Superintendent of Police, and 15 percent, for ranks above it. The officers also feel that they do not have the facilities and amenities of local police investigation units. Still the conviction rate (of above 65 percent), is one of the best in the country. The more recently created National Investigation Agency (NIA) will take decades to come up to the benchmark set by the CBI. In most of the cases, the investigators work independently, but in some cases, there are pressures from different quarters. Most officers are able to withstand these pressures, as documentation is very strong within the CBI. If you are able to justify your stand on paper, it is difficult to be overruled. However, some officers do find cunning ways to bypass these, including taking legal opinion in their favour. Courts intervene occasionally and initiate direct supervision with clear direction not to transfer/shift the investigating officers and the supervisors â€“ as was the case with the investigation of the 2G spectrum allocation case, and coal scam cases. With a professional work culture, a strong internal vigilance wing, and an internationally-acclaimed training set-up, the Central Bureau of Investigation holds its head high â€“ more often than not. On the whole, having worked in the CBI, I can safely vouch for its professionalism, and fervently hope that the current director and special director resolve their differences for a higher cause, that is, the ethos of their organisation. Both officers being from the Indian Police Service, should stand up for the â€˜service of the peopleâ€™ and NOT for â€˜the service of the party in powerâ€™. (This opinion piece was first published on   by   and has been republished in the aftermath of CBI Director Alok Vermaâ€™s resignation.)"
14-05-2018,Mayukh Ghosh,"Reminiscing about the bad past is a dreadful tool that filmmakers often use to bring out a certain empathy for a character stuck in a specific time period. But it is also equally true for the filmmakers themselves, who are often stuck in the past, unresponsive to the present environment, reacting to it only through memories. And then there are those filmmakers who receive an instant emotional blow from the socio-political situation of the present and hurl away the burden of the past to deliver a message for the present. His cinema can be divided into distinct periods, etching out the contemporary sensibilities of the times they were made in. My first experience of a Mrinal Sen film was of    which shows a young boy dying of suffocation on a winter night, in a middle-class Bengali householdâ€™s kitchen. I had seen   only too often â€” working in the houses of some of my friends, whom I would visit after school. Mrinal Senâ€™s    , which shows a film crew attempting to make a film based on the Bengal famine (set in a village of the day), fuses the horrors of history with the struggles of contemporary life. The classical structure of a â€˜film within a filmâ€™ has been used by Sen to show how fiction and reality often converge. Durga, an ordinary village woman, who witnesses the film shoot, begins to empathise with a character portrayed in the film. The hardships faced by Durga in real life, and this character, are very similar. Mrinal Sen also depicts the exploitation of the innocent, ignorant villagers at the hands of the privileged film personalities. Sen made this film at a time when he wanted to study characters through a socio-political lens â€” understanding their responses, moral dilemmas, self-corruption and exploitation, which can then provoke the spectator to start a discussion. In dramas like   and  Sen sheds light on the moralities of the society of the day, especially exposing the so-called Bhadralok (gentleman) culture. In  , a middle-class familyâ€™s fate hangs in the balance as their eldest daughter, the sole breadwinner, fails to come home one night. Similarly, in  , the father, the familyâ€™s patriarch, goes missing. My understanding of Mrinal Sen completely changed once I went to college and got involved in the politics of the day. I had a lot to say, and I was ready to shout over the burst of other voices. Mrinal Sen started â€˜shouting out his own politicsâ€™ with his cult-classic   at a time when the Naxalite movement was at its peak, and world cinema was highly influenced by the French New Wave and Czech New Wave. The film is highly stylised with use of freeze frames and stop-motion animation. An animation sequence builds up the character of Shome (who is mostly engrossed in office work) through pens, books, files, sheets, but without actually showing him. Thus, Sen developed a new language for Indian filmmakers, giving birth to the Indian New Wave. The period demanded that Sen shout out his views over ear-blasting bombings and cries of mothers of youths shot dead by police. Mrinal Senâ€™s   trilogy, a set of overly political films narrated in the new vocabulary of the day, also emerged around the same time. Sen breaks the fourth wall in  , and directly speaks to the camera.  and   the other two films in the  trilogy â€“ both deal with questions of leadership and exploitation by the higher-ups. Sen used â€˜juxtapositionâ€™ as an important cinematic tool to jar the spectators out of the illusion of cinema. Mrinal Senâ€™s cinema has not only inspired other films, but also compelled other filmmakers to document his life and work. The creation of a new wave in Indian cinema, which was subsequently continued by the likes of Mani Kaul, Kumar Shahani, and Shyam Benegal, can be credited to Sen. Sen completely distrusts Ramaniâ€™s presence and his sensibilities â€” Senâ€™s aura, comes out with an absolute honesty in the final documentary, which in the last sequence, cuts to Sen watching himself on screen as Ramani shows him the footage for approval. Mrinal Sen, the â€˜masterâ€™ smiles at his â€˜other selfâ€™, jarred out of illusion into realism through his most favourite cinematic device of all â€” the â€˜cutâ€™.

30-04-2018,Akanksha Kumar,": Akanksha Kumar : Sandeep Suman Twenty-three years later as former Delhi Police Joint Commissioner Maxwell Pereira recalled his experience of leading the probe into the murder of Naina Sahni, a case that shocked the entire country, he didnâ€™t seem to have any regret for his strong comments. On 3 July 1995, Delhi woke up to a crime that was less gruesome in execution but was brutal enough when it came to removing evidence, including the victimâ€™s body. In the post-liberalisation era, even as blaring 24*7 news channels were yet to arrive on the scene, few newspapers made sure that the readers had every salacious bit on their platter daily. The accused Sushil Sharma, a former Youth Congress leader, someone who was known for his proximity to senior leaders, had shot his wife dead and then tried to burn her body.Â  It was perhaps the sheer grit and dogged effort by Pereira and his team which ensured that Sharma was behind bars. But it wasnâ€™t so easy for the Delhi Police that faced many challenges during investigation, as explained vividly by Pereira in his book,  . This observation was contrary to the claim by the police that Naina Sahni's death was caused due to injury caused by a bullet wound with the shot being fired from a very close range. The police had retrieved bullets and empty cartridges from Sushil Sharma's flat at Mandir Marg where traces of blood were found on the mattress in the bedroom. Just because the X-ray machine at the Lady Hardinge Medical College was non-functional and the body was burnt beyond recognition, the first autopsy report had overlooked the injury mark in the corpse caused by the bullets. It was the second autopsy report that favoured the sequence of events as was established by the Delhi Police in its probe. Pereira feels that such procedural hassles are part of the job for investigating officers: Speaking to  , Pereira also shared how important it was for the police force then in 1995 to win back the confidence of people. Sharma was sentenced to death by a trial court in 2003, which was upheld by the Delhi High Court in 2007. On 8 October 2013, the Supreme Court commuted Sushil Sharmaâ€™s death sentence to life imprisonment. In its judgment, the bench headed by the then Chief Justice of India, P Sathasivam had  : The Court was of the view that chances of reformation of Sharma canâ€™t be ruled out. Sushil Sharma has already served 23 years behind bars. So should he now be allowed to live a normal life outside jail on grounds of good behaviour? It was this question that resulted in a fierce debate between the author and audience at the book launch. A counselor at the Tihar Jail, who was present at the book launch, shared her experience of interacting with Sharma, as she claimed, â€œhe regrets his actionâ€. In 2016, the Supreme Court   that â€œa sentence of imprisonment for life does not automatically expire at the end of 20 yearsâ€. Which means that the release of Sushil Sharma would be tough â€œunless the appropriate Government chooses to exercise its discretion to remit either the whole or a part of the sentenceâ€. According to Maxwell Pereira, â€œthe police had done its job and now itâ€™s up to the institutions who take decisions on such mattersâ€. What happened to Constable Abdul Nazeer Kunju, the man, who was on night duty at the Connaught Place police station on 2 July 1995? It was Kunju who had rushed inside the Bagiya restaurant after a woman came out shouting,  It was Kunju who first spotted Sushil along with his friend Keshav as both were busy throwing pamphlets and posters into the fire. â€˜He left the police serviceâ€™, Pereira told the audience, when he was asked about Kunju. After his stint as the hero, who had helped in unravelling a gruesome crime, it was the slow pace of promotion in the hierarchical setup of the police that led to Kunju calling it quits. While Kunju was able to resist all the efforts of Sushil Sharma to intimidate him, the poor guy found it difficult to overcome disillusionment that dawned after years of performing his duties with utmost sincerity. Lack of motivation is perhaps among the many ills ailing the police force. Pereira still reminisces the ability of Kunju to react fast to an unwarranted situation, which in this case, led to the discovery of a charred body:       (What does the first-time woman voter want?

29-01-2018,Poonam Agarwal,"As many as 92 witnesses in the Sohrabuddin fake encounter case turned hostile during cross-examination in the court.  has exclusively accessed the list of 30 prosecution witnesses who turned hostile while they were crossed examined before the CBI court in Mumbai. On 23 November 2005, Sohrabuddin Sheikh and his wife Kausar Bi were travelling by bus from Hyderabad to Sangli in Mahrashtra. While on the way, the Gujarat Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) stopped the bus and abducted the couple. Three days later, on 26 November, Sohrabuddin was shot dead in what the police called an encounter, but it was later found to be fake by the investigators. In total, several prosecution witnesses have deposed before the court since 29 November 2017. The same day, the special CBI court passed a gag order restraining media from reporting the case based on an application by the defence lawyer. On 24 January this year, the Bombay High Court struck down the gag order. According to sources, all hostile witnesses are crucial, and some of them are also eyewitnesses in the case. Among these, five of their statements were recorded before a magistrate under Section 164 of the CrPC, while others had theirs recorded by the investigating agency. Below are details of the testimony/statements of 13 crucial witnesses: , the sister of Kalimuddin, an associate of Sohrabuddin, had stated to the investigating agency that her brother hosted Sohrabuddin and his wife in Hyderabad in mid-November 2005. It is from their house that Sohrabuddin and his wife left for Sangli. Kalimuddin was also wanted in several criminal cases by the Andhra Pradesh Police. But during cross-examination, Saleema denied even having met Sohrabuddin and Kausar Bi. Saleemaâ€™s retraction of her earlier statement will impact the case because this raises questions over whether Sohrabuddin and his wife went to Hyderabad or boarded the bus to Sangli. Here are the names of some other hostile witnesses: According to the prosecution, key witnesses turning hostile is a major setback for the case. According to a legal expert: Sohrabuddin and Kausar Bi had boarded a luxury bus from Hyderabad to go to Sangli in Maharashtra at around 9 pm on 22 November 2005. But while they were on the way, a group of policemen from Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh allegedly kidnapped them. A passenger inside the bus told the investigator that an SUV blocked their bus and three policemen with guns abducted Sohrabuddin and his wife. Kausar Bi refused to allow the police to take him, and so she too was abducted by the police. Based on the statements of some witnesses, Sohrabuddin and his wife were brought to Ahmedabadâ€™s Disha Farm where both of them were illegally detained and later killed, according to the charge-sheet filed by the CBI. According to the Gujarat ATS, Sohrabuddin was a sharp shooter and had underworld connections. He had come to the city at the behest of the Lashker-e-Taiba and the ISI to assassinate a political leader. The Gujarat Police acted on the basis of an intelligence input from the Rajasthan Police, who were also part of the encounter team. The Gujarat Police also claimed that Sohrabuddin was wanted in an arms case in Madhya Pradesh and in a murder case in Rajasthan. According to the Gujarat police, Sohrabuddin was operating from Narol area in Ahmedabad, when the police spotted him riding a bike near the Vishala circle, they tried to intercept but he didn't stop. In a desperate attempt to escape, Sohrabuddin shot at policemen and in self-defence police retaliated, killing him. They offer no explanation for how Kausar Bi was killed. Some key witnesses who are yet to be cross-examined in court are:  once a close associate of Sohrabuddin, turned hostile from his earlier statement recorded before the CBI. In an affidavit before the designated CBI court, witness claimed that the statements attributed to him against the former Deputy Police Commissioner of Ahmedabad, Abhay Chudasma, and others, were â€œtaken by the investigating agency under duress.â€ He also charged the CBI with â€œacting on the instructions of Congress leaders of Gujarat.â€ In 2006,  the IPS officer of Gujarat cadre, was made the supervisory officer of the Sohrabuddin case before it was handed over to the CBI. Solankiâ€™s investigation revealed that apart from Sohrabuddin, Kausar Bi was also killed as a coverup. This revelation led to the arrests of Gujarat-cadre IPS officers DG Vanzara and Rajkumar Pandian, and Dinesh MN of the Rajasthan cadre. Later, the CBI, in its findings, charge-sheeted Geetha Johri for allegedly botching up the investigation. The agency accused her of projecting that the third person abducted along with Sohrabuddin and Kausar Bi was a person named Kalimuddin and not Tulsiram Prajapati. The first investigating officer of the Gujarat Police gave a statement to the CBI against  , saying she was working under pressure from now Bharatiya Janata Party president Amit Shah. She botched-up the case by giving a false report stating that third person on the bus was not Tulsiram Prajapati. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you. "

31-08-2018,Indira Basu,"Ahead of the Rajasthan assembly elections on 7 December, the Congress partyâ€™s state President Sachin Pilot, spoke to  . In a scathing critique, Pilot said of the incumbent Rajasthan government: It is believed that there is a strong sense of anti-incumbency on ground. So is it Modi who will have to step in to salvage Rajeâ€™s government? Pilot goes on to say, â€œSo, today if Modi and Amit Shah go and campaign for the BJP in Rajasthan, they have to account for the last 4 and a half years of Vasundhara jiâ€™s government. So itâ€™s not easy to cover-up the misdeeds of Rajeâ€™s government and then ask for 5 more years. People have to know where the performance was.â€ From the large turnout, it seems that Vasundhara Rajeâ€™s â€˜Gaurav Yatraâ€™ was a success. What are your thoughts on this? This yatra that she is doing now is basically a face-saving exercise. As I keep saying, as opposed to â€˜Gaurav Yatraâ€™, Raje should have taken out a â€˜Pashchatap Yatraâ€™. She must atone for the sins she has committed as chief minister in the last 4 and a half years. And now Vasundhara ji, to counter the Congressâ€™s work, is taking out this Gaurav Yatra, which is on government expense. Itâ€™s illegal, itâ€™s immoral to use taxpayersâ€™ money to do a political yatra. BJP is a rich party. Why is Vasundhara Raje not using the BJPâ€™s money to organise meetings? â€œToday, the Rajasthan government is paying for the tent, loudspeakers, for ferrying people, for all the expenses of the party meetings, which Amit Shah had launched. So I think they are misusing the taxpayers' money, and that too for political purposes. People are watching all this very carefully. And the people who are coming out to listen to Raje are not going to vote for her. They were brought there because the government machinery was fully deployed,â€ continued Sachin Pilot. Is the Congressâ€™s counter-narrative to Rajeâ€™s aggressive campaigns strong enough? There was no BJP president for 2 and a half months in Rajasthan. At that time, we (Congress party) went to the rural parts of Rajasthan, and out of 200 constituencies, we had â€˜mera booth, mera gauravâ€™ programmes in 196. 50,000 booths, booth workers identifying them, linking them to the â€˜Shaktiâ€™ project, and really, giving them political tasks. That was done at the grassroots and the booth-level. Thatâ€™s what we did in the summer. Pilot added, â€œWe (Congress) are doing â€˜Sankalpâ€™ rallies across Rajasthan. Rahul Gandhi came on 11 August and did a massive roadshow in Jaipur. We have a rally on 28 August and on 5, 10 and 12 September. So our campaign is fully on the ground.â€ Is the Congress likely to fall into the trap of complacency in Rajasthan? We are getting tremendous traction and without sounding immodest, I want to say that, I believe that the feedback weâ€™ve gotten so far, the reactions, the attendance people have marked; young people in urban areas, rural areas are coming in hordes to show their faith in the Congress. So itâ€™s a very positive indication, and Iâ€™m very confident that in December, when the elections happen, weâ€™ll be able to secure a historic mandate. Why should Rajasthan vote for the Congress? 150 farmers have committed suicide. For the first time in Rajasthan, so many farmers are killing themselves. And here, Raje is taking out Gaurav Yatras when women are getting raped, farmers are committing suicide, young people are jobless. So this sort of situation is untenable. People want a change, and they want a positive change. And thatâ€™s where I think the Congress partyâ€™s role is very, very crucial. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

27-03-2018,Kingshuk Nag,"In February 2015, barely months after ascending the throne, KCRâ€™s cops were able to catch a TDP MLA red-handed trying to bribe an independent MLA to vote in favour of the party in the (then forthcoming) legislative council election. Even as the TDP MLA was jailed, a tape was produced (and leaked to TV channels) where a voice suspiciously similar to that of Chandrababu Naiduâ€™s, was found saying something incriminating. This was an opportunity for KCRâ€™s Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) to poach TDP MLAs who Naidu had told to fend for themselves. At the same time, to ensure that Andhra industrialists did not flee to Andhra Pradesh leaving Hyderabad high and dry, KCR appointed his son KT Rama Rao (KTR) to woo them. The savvy KTR, who is IT and Urban Development Minister in KCRâ€™s government, was able to win the confidence of these industrialists who were at the receiving end during the Telangana statehood movement. Naidu is hailed as the father of modern Hyderabad, who got Microsoft and other IT investments. But KTR is following in his footsteps and has been able to woo many others. â€œHyderabad is a boom town now,â€ is the refrain of investors. Although he is believed to have strategised Naiduâ€™s victory in 1999, Naidu jettisoned KCR, relegating him to the post of the Assemblyâ€™s deputy speaker. A miffed KCR left TDP and formed TRS to fight for a separate state. The new state was created by Sonia Gandhi on the eve of the 2014 elections. Before Telangana was announced, KCR had declared his allegiance to Sonia â€” who he said was like his own â€˜motherâ€™ and even promised to merge his party into the Congress if â€˜he was given a free hand.â€™ But none of this happened, and the TRS and Congress are now arch rivals. Even as KCR wants to decimate the Congress, analysts aver that he has a tacit understanding with the BJP because this is what the saffron party also wants. However, in April 2017, KCR got a bill passed in the Telangana Assembly to provide reservations to backward Muslims in colleges and for jobs. This is unlikely to be notified by the central government, because reservations on religious basis have been struck down by the courts. Moreover, with the latest proposals, total reservations will go way beyond the constitutionally mandated upper limit of 50 percent. KCR, who runs the state with an iron hand and has promoted his daughter and nephew besides his son, is seen as a wily politician with a clear game plan in mind. This is why he is being taken seriously as he unfolds the federal front plan. K Chandrasekhar Rao (KCR) is a man known for setting his goals high. Figuring that the â€˜Modi magicâ€™ of 2014 has all but vanished and has not been replaced by a Rahul Gandhi upsurge, KCR is fancying his chances as the next prime minister of India, suggest highly-placed sources. Donning the robe of a messiah, KCR has been announcing that â€œPeople are vexed that there is no qualitative change, even after 70 years of democracy.â€ KCR, as has been reported, travelled to Kolkata to confabulate with West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for forming a federal front. He has also met CPMâ€™s Sitaram Yechury with the same idea. The leaders of many likely federal front partners with more seats (like Mamata with 42 seats in West Bengal) might harbour prime ministerial ambitions themselves. But KCR, with his proficiency in both Hindi and English, and being from south India, feels that he has an edge over others (What does the first-time woman voter want?

29-11-2018,Kota Neelima,"Rural Telangana, where almost 62 percent of the population lives, had played a crucial role in the formation of the new state in 2014. As the Legislative Assembly goes to polls on 7 December, narratives of families of farmer suicides in the prosperous Nalgonda district, highlight how little their life has changed. Nalgonda has the highest number of farmer suicides, according to data available since the stateâ€™s formation. Kathula Venkataiah, 45, committed suicide like thousands of farmers do every year in India, because of crop failure and unpaid debts. But this farmer suicide was different. A resident of Manimadde village of Shali Gowraram mandal in Nalgonda district, Venkataiah was a staunch supporter of the separate state of Telangana. He had participated in village marches and believed that Telanganaâ€™s statehood would be the best solution for the rural distress he himself faced, and witnessed around him. And yet, he killed himself 12 days after the formation of Telangana on 2 June 2014. Inability to repay debt was the main reason for Venkataiahâ€™s suicide; he had owed Rs 4,30,000 at the time of his death, according to official documents. As Venkataiah did not own land, banks had trouble lending to him, and he borrowed from private moneylenders on an interest of Rs 1.50 to Rs 2. This dependence on private moneylenders is despite over 83 percent rural access to bank credit, according to the same report. Further, government schemes like Rythu Bandhu, are meant for farmers who cultivate their own land, and not for tenant/landless farmers who are the worst affected by distress. A report by Rythu Swarajya Vedika with TISS in 2018, finds that 20 percent of land in the state is cultivated by tenant farmers, but they account for 75 percent of farmer suicides in Telangana. The children of tenant farmers face a different challenge; there is no land to farm, and education does not lead to employment. Even with 64.2 percent literacy rate, Nalgonda district has only 49.9 percent working population, according to the 2011 Census. It is not surprising therefore, that after Venkataiahâ€™s death, all his three children dropped out of school to earn a livelihood instead. In Manimadde village, where the family met this reporter this week, they live in a half-constructed two-room house of cement and brick. Part of the state compensation paid after Venkataiahâ€™s death had gone into building the house, but was not enough to finish it. In another part of Nalgonda in Chandanpally village, Rupani Radha recalls the death of her husband, Janayya, in November 2014, four months after the formation of Telangana state. She now supports three children between the ages of 8-14 years, through farm labour, and by cultivating cotton on 2 acres of rain-fed land that used to belong to her husband. The land is now in the name of her 8-year-old son, transferred by her husbandâ€™s family after his death. This has proved a hurdle for getting benefits of government schemes as her son is not of age. Welfare had failed to assist her in times of need. For instance, when she had to undergo a surgery for kidney stones in June 2018, she had to borrow Rs 1 lakh from private sources. She says that the free health scheme â€˜Aarogyasriâ€™ would have taken time to come though, and she could not wait. And now, after the surgery, the loan has added to her burden as she is unable to do farm labour to repay it. Radhaâ€™s only other option is agriculture. â€œI must work as farm labour to pay for the cotton crop on our field. I have harvested about 5 quintals, which will fetch me about Rs 20,000, but I will make no profit,â€ she says. But like Narsamma, even Radha must reconcile to the indifference of the state that no longer needs the farmer, except perhaps, during elections.  â€˜ â€™ by        (What does the first-time woman voter want?

02-02-2018,Arushi Vats,"A recent finding of 27,000 documents throws light on the only liberal party India has ever had, allowing us to probe its contribution to Indian politics in the 15 years of its existence. Founded in 1959, by C Rajagopalachari, one of Indiaâ€™s greatest political thinkers and leaders, as well as literary giants, Swatantra Party arrived on the Indian political scene with a bash. The archive features correspondences, office memorandums, meeting minutes, speech drafts, party literature and publications, and many personal notes shared by the party leaders, allowing us a glimpse into the life of the party as it was conceived, formed, and introduced to the larger Indian political scene. A small correspondence between Indira Gandhi and MR Masani, notes shared by Masani and Rajaji are among the many treasures housed in the archive. In the letter issued from the Prime Ministers Office on 12 March 1967, Indira Gandhi invites Mr Masani to join her in an informal meeting with parliamentary leaders, before the inaugural session of Lok Sabha. The letter reads: â€œI write this to invite you to an informal meeting of Leaders of different Parties in Parliament so that we have an opportunity of meeting one another on the eve of the session and to exchange views on matters of common interest. I should like to maintain similar contact throughout the session if you find the idea appropriate and useful. I wonder if we could have our first meeting at 10 am on 15th March in my office in Parliament House. I hope you will find it convenient to join.â€ A handwritten note by C Rajagopalachari, addressed to Mr Homi Mody, a lawyer, administrator, businessman, and social reformer is another valuable find. Homi, a moniker for Sir Hormasji Pherozshah Modi, held a variety of public offices as Chairman of Bombay Municipal Corporation (1913), a member of Indian legislative assembly (1929-1943), a member of Viceroyâ€™s Executive Council (1943), a member of Constituent Assembly of India, and governor of United Provinces and Uttar Pradesh (1949-52). In the note C Rajagopalachari expresses his gratitude to Mody for leading the early collection efforts to establish the corpus of funds for the party. Written on 20 October 1959 â€“ Swatantra's founding year â€“ the note states, â€œIt was kind of you to write and give a cheerful account of the collection work. I had intended to write to our staff about the need for active assistance but as I have just read your letter, I feel it is unnecessary. I cannot tell you how greatly I feel heartened by your continued support. Tyranny cannot be brought to an end until the victims shed fear. Our 'friends' are going to get more and more autocratic and dictatorial seeing that we are gathering strength...â€ The archive has been successfully restored and digitised by the efforts of the Centre for Civil Society as a part of its Indian Liberals digital archive project, and will be placed at Nehru Memorial Museum and Library for public engagement, and will soon be available on the open Indian Liberal website for visitors. According to Rajaji, a liberal democracy rests on four pillars, or feet: an active citizenry, prudent statesmen, a responsible parliament, and independent judiciary. The party was Rajajiâ€™s response to the rise of what he saw as the â€˜one-footedâ€™ democracyâ€”a monolithic Congress system, which had erupted due to the absence of a sustained and principled opposition, and a fractured electoral system which rewarded expensive campaigns mounted by those in power with subsequent victories. Rajajiâ€™s greatest concern was the rise of majoritarianism, which he felt was eroding the democratic nature of our public institutions. Congressâ€™ eclipsing victories at national and state level in the 1950s, the abuse of ordinances by the Nehru Government in the early 1950s as a means to subvert scrutiny by both houses, the misuse of Ninth Schedule to overcome judicial review, and the increase in instances of agitation and boycott by Parliamentarians troubled Rajaji, for they threatened to erode the sanctity of institutional procedures. Writing on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti in 1963, he argued â€œdemocracy in a pluralist society is sustained not by force of numbers but by the vital force of trust, the maintenance of which must, therefore be the greatest concern of statesmen guiding democracies.â€ No less than a year old, it commanded the presence of many of Indiaâ€™s greatest statesmen and thinkers. M R Masani, Dahyabhai Patel (son of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel), Sir Homi Mody, Nirmal Chandra Chatterjee, VP Menon, Maridas Ruthnaswamy, N G Ranga, and more. The party boasted of a wide and diverse leadership, bringing together voices from the South as well as Northern India, peasant and agrarian activists and aristocrats on one platform. The party had offices and regional centres in Madras, Bombay, Bangalore, Mysore, and Patna, with units in Himachal Pradesh, UP, Bengal, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh and Orissa. It was the only national party to not have an office in Delhi, and this was done to ensure candidates and party leaders stayed close to their respective constituencies. The party also held one of the few female members of royal families to participate in electoral politics: Maharani Gayatri Devi, who campaigned relentlessly for the party in the 1962 elections. While the party performed well in the general elections of 1962 and 1967, it could not withstand the rising forces of extremism and majoritarianism in the 1970s, and floundered after Rajajiâ€™s demise in 1974 â€“ only a few months before the imposition of Emergency.

31-10-2018,The Quint,"Senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Monday, 10 December, filed a criminal complaint against Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad in Thiruvananthapuram over alleged defamatory remarks, reported news agency ANI. On 31 October, Tharoor had sent a legal notice to the law minister for allegedly calling him an â€œaccused in a murder caseâ€ after Prasad took offence to Tharoor ""disrespecting Lord Shiva"". Tharoor also raised objection to the remarks made by Prasad in a video he had tweeted in October. Through his notice to the Union minister, the Congress MP had sought an apology within 48 hours over â€œfalse and defamatory statementsâ€ and had threatened Prasad with legal action. Speaking at the Bangalore Lit Fest in October, Tharoor had allegedly likened PM Modi to a â€˜scorpion sitting atop a Shiv Lingâ€™, attributing the analogy to a journalistâ€™s RSS source.

30-11-2018,Aishwarya S Iyer,"Mohd Irshad Alam Not only did Manvendra Singh quit the BJP and join the Congress party ahead of the Rajasthan Assembly elections, but is now also contesting against sitting BJP Chief Minister Vasudhara Raje.  met him in Rajasthanâ€™s Jhalawar district, where he stands from Jhalrapatan constituency, a seat that Raje has won for three consecutive terms. He is the son of Jaswant Singh, a tall Rajpur leader who, despite being one of the founding members of the Bharatiya Janata Party, was denied a ticket to contest the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. This battle for Manvendra is a personal one that he did not want to fight in the first place. Vasundhara Raje has been winning from this seat for three consecutive terms, and the margin she is winning by has also steadily increased from 27,000 in 2003 to 61,000 votes in 2013. What do you think will work in your favour? I think every election is a different situation. Particularly in 2018, where the politics of Rajasthan has taken a huge turn. There is an underswell against a particular kind of governance, which is palpable under the surface across the state. Coming here, I feel the underswell is also covered with a huge campaign against tyranny. All polls have predicted a Congress win in the state, sir. You are Jaswant Singhâ€™s son, you have won before, you are politically relevant in Mewar. So, would it have been better for you to stand from Barmer as opposed to here, where you are contesting against somebody who hasÂ  a political legacy here for 30-35 years, and has been an MLA here for three consecutive terms? Certainly it would have been better to stand from the Barmer-Jodhpur side, but that is if I wanted to contest and I did not want to contest. So that question is not so connected to me because it is a question for the will to win, I mean, the will to contest, which I didnâ€™t have. An offer like this, as the quote says from   the movie, â€œMake an offer I cannot refuse.â€ So yeah, they made an offer I couldnâ€™t refuse. All polls say the Congress will win. You could have stood from a lot of other seats where anti-incumbency is strong, where leaders are not so strong, but they put you here, where there is a good chance that you might lose. Sure, I am realistic about it. I am not being romantic about the results. I am realistic about the situation. But donâ€™t you think there could have been an easier gateway to being an MLA if it was from a different place? If they really truly wanted you to be representative... I donâ€™t think you should find a conspiracy. There is a conspiracy in the question. There is no conspiracy in my nomination from here. In case you lose, is there something they (the Congress) have promised theyâ€™ll give you despite that? I am not in a situation... My fondness for Rahul Gandhi does not permit me to have a bargaining power. Why are you fond of him, sir? We became MPs together and we continued to be in touch. Iâ€™ve seen him grow as he has a (sense of) responsibility, which most of us do not have. I have seen him grow into responsibility. People generally tend to vote for a probable CM candidate from a constituency  , they automatically come on the map. Do you think that might work against you as well? It may. It may also work to my advantage. Sir, it sounds like... Do you think you might lose?  I hope not. It could also work to my advantage. This is an uphill task for you, when Jaswant Singh sir was not given the ticket for the 2014 LS polls, it wasnâ€™t good for the Rajputs of Mewar, to say one thing. Do you think if you lose this, you will be able to survive the political game? Iâ€™m sure I will. The goodwill is flowing enormously from everywhere across spectrum of communities. Your wife has accompanied you on the campaign trail, does she like it? Do you have fights about it later in the evening? No, we do not have fights like that, but like all women, she does not like surprises. Surprise gifts are okay, but you canâ€™t be surprised with an election campaign like this. So she was not happy being surprised like that. What was the surprising factor? The fact that we didnâ€™t ask for a ticket, I mean, nobody wanted. People wanted someone to contest from the family, but I was not keen on contesting. You were expecting her â€“ your wife, Chitra Singh â€“ of contesting from here. Why do you think she is a good fit for the region? A, because her village is not very far from here, in that sense, she is a geographical neighbour and a cultural neighbour in an immediate sense. And more than anything else, because she is a woman, she has an extra allowance, which I donâ€™t have. If you lose, sir, would you be upset with the Congress for making you stand from here? No, not at all. This should not be seen as a conspiracy, but as a gesture which has great significance. Rajasthan votes on 7 December and the results will be out on 11 December.

19-09-2018,The Quint,"Christian Michel, the alleged middleman in the VVIP chopper scam and UK national, was extradited to India from UAE in the wee hours of Wednesday, 5 December. But just a few months ago, Michel had reportedly gone missing. Michelâ€™s lawyer, Amal Alsubei had told   that Michel had gone missing from the day UAE went to the court. Alsubei also added that the middleman in the Rs 3,600 crore deal will be arrested when found, and that he is likely to appeal in Supreme Court. According to the reports, on 26 August, UAE had asked a court on the possibility of extraditing a British national, not specifically Michel, to a third country,   reported. The reports of Michel going missing came a day after reports of a UAE court ordering extradition of the middleman to India surfaced. Michel was arrested in the UAE in 2017 and was out on bail then. At the time of the Rs 3,600-crore scam (early 2013), Christian Michel was a well-known British consultant who was very active in the Indian defence sector. It was alleged that he was hired by AgustaWestland to facilitate the deal for the supply of 12 helicopters to India in 2010. Michel is one of the three middlemen being probed in the case, besides Guido Haschke and Carlo Gerosa, by the ED and CBI. The ED had also brought on the record that the three middlemen ""managed to"" make inroads into the Indian Air Force (IAF) to influence the stand of officials to reduce the service ceiling of the helicopters from 6,000 metres to 4,500 metres in 2005, according to PTI. AgustaWestland became eligible to supply the dozen helicopters for VVIP flying duties after this change. Moreover, according to ED investigation, remittances made by Michel through his Dubai-based firm Global Services to a media firm he floated in Delhi, along with two Indians, were made from the funds which he got from AgustaWestland through â€œcriminal activityâ€ and corruption being done in the chopper deal, reported PTI. In July 2018, after he was granted bail in Dubai, Michel had accused Indian investigators of pressuring him to name UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and frame senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel in return for a clean chit in the multi-crore scam. On 19 July, while he was in custody, his lawyer Rosemary Patrizi had made similar charges against the Indian probe agencies, although CBI had denied the allegations.

As ruling Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao (KCR) is busy promising welfare schemes to farmers, he has competition brewing in the opposition camp. Congress leader Uttam Kumar Reddy has filed his nomination in his home ground, the Huzurnagar constituency, and many say he could be the chief ministerial candidate floated by the grand alliance. The rally saw hundreds of people dancing, flags waving, loud sloganeering and   (folk dance). caught up with the Congress leader to find out how he plans to defeat the KCR government this time. In a candid conversation, Reddy said that he hopes their party doesnâ€™t repeat any of these mistakes. â€œThis time, we have been far more careful and hopefully those mistakes won't be repeated. I am fairly sure that the people's front we have formed now â€“ Congress-TDP-CPM-TJS â€“ we will win the elections with an overwhelming majority,â€ said Reddy. He criticised the ruling government for failing farmers, youth and women. â€œHe promised something and didnâ€™t do it. He looted the state. He has been an oppressive dictator, trying to suppress people's rights. I think he has been exposed now,â€ he added. He alleged that the chief ministerâ€™s move to dissolve the Telangana Assembly was a conspiracy. On 6 September 2018, KCR recommended the dissolution of the Assembly and called for early elections. He had said that he was doing it in the interests of the state, and that he wanted to curb the stateâ€™s political fragility. However, Reddy said he suspects the early election has been a result of a conspiracy between PM Narendra Modi, the Election Commission, and KCR. He said there was no other explanation for how the schedule announced by KCR was exactly the same as what was announced by the Election Commission. Reddy was a former fighter pilot and served as the Comptroller of Security, Protocol, Administration, Foreign Trips of the President at Rashtrapathi Bhavan. He is a four-time MLA and a former minister of Housing. Reddy said his agenda, if elected to power, would be to introduce farm loan waivers, unemployment toll, financial incentives to womenâ€™s self-help groups, and remunerative prices for farmers to purchase crops. If Congress wins, Reddy could become the chief minister â€“ but when asked, he chooses to leave it to Rahul Gandhi. â€œI have no such ambitions.

30-11-2018,Sanjiv Krishan Sood,"The Border Security Force, the largest border guarding force in the world, celebrated its 54th Raising day on 1 December. Tasked with guarding borders with Pakistan and Bangladesh, the force has a vital role in ensuring the security and integrity of nation. 53 years ago, policy makers conceived of a force capable of guarding borders during peace, and to assist the army as the first line of defence during hostilities, because of the inability of the disparate State Armed Forces to stand up to even minor threats from Pakistani forces, and lack of uniformity in dealing with its counterparts. The force has grown from about 25,000 in 1965, to about 2.5 lakhs now. This mammoth growth has been in spurts, causing many problems of human resource management. The policy planners erred in ensuring a smooth phased expansion to prevent the personnel management dilemma that the force is now faced with. However, the one-time benefits of such rapid expansion has reached its saturation point, and the personnel are now stagnating for long periods, leading to dissatisfaction and demoralisation. A  takes anything from 20 to 24 years to earn his first promotion. The situation of the cadre officers of the force has always been precarious, with most of them retiring at the middle rungs. Efforts to address the problem of stagnation have lacked vision, and amounted only to fire fighting. For example, in order to bring parity with the police, the ranks of Lance Naik were abolished, thus disturbing the rank structure of a â€œsectionâ€ which is the basic sub-unit. Similarly, the introduction of the rank of assistant sub inspector has disturbed the structure of â€œplatoonâ€. The cadre review exercise for officers has, without aiming for long-term solutions, resulted only in one-time postponement of stagnation through proliferation of ranks in the battalions. Avenues created at higher levels do not accrue to cadre officers because of the rule position, and these have been usurped by IPS officers. He frequently encounters life-threatening situations, but is now not entitled to pension which his counterpart in defence forces get. Large numbers of BSF units are deployed on the Line of Control, and perform the same duties as the Army. Yet, he gets almost 25 percent less than his Army counterpart. Further, in case of an unfortunate death in the line of duty, the family of a deceased BSF soldier is deprived of many benefits available to the family of an Army Jawan, because there is no provision for a BSF soldier to be declared a martyr. BSF personnel spend most of their life on BOPs where the extended duty hours â€“ sometimes 16 per day, enable only an interrupted sleep. To make matters worse, the living conditions at most of the BOPs are unsatisfactory. A recent report stated that out of the 66 BOPs in Barmer sector of BSF, only two had facilities for piped drinking water. The rest depended upon water tankers. The above conditions coupled with the inability to meet urgent family obligations, cause a lot of stress, resulting in a high rate of attrition. As per a reply to a parliament question, 11,192 BSF personnel have either resigned or proceeded on voluntary retirement from 2015 up-to Jan 2018. The prevalent security environment now â€“ both internal and external â€“ is vastly different from that in 1965. The proxy war by Pakistan has kept our western borders troubled, requiring aggressive border management practices. The Bangladesh border grapples with a threat of a different kind, with armed cattle smugglers attacking BSF soldiers, when intercepted. Heavy population density, lack of development and employment opportunities makes these borders highly crime prone. The BSF is thus faced with the policy dilemma of averting use of force to conform to the national objective of maintaining good relations with Bangladesh, and ensuring the safety and security of soldiers, while preventing crime. Man-power intensive border guarding practices are no longer adequate, and suitable technology has to be introduced to assist border men. Technological interventions in the shape of first and second generation NVDs have had a rather limited effect, and the situation on ground remains unchanged. These devices, besides having out lived their life, are cumbersome and  user-friendly. The organisation also has not invested in familiarizing troops with the usage of these devices, which is another reason for reluctance on the part of troops to use them. The technology sought to be introduced is generally vendor-driven, which more often than not, fails on ground. Trials must be carried out over an extended period in operational conditions before induction. Aspects of training in their use, maintenance etc must also be built in the contract to prevent long turn over time for repairs. Proper facilities should be created at BOPs to derive optimum advantage from devices like Thermal Imagers. Annual competition to encourage innovation remains just an event, and none of the projects have been taken up for large scale production to ease the burden on troops. The mindset of the commanders therefore, requires a generational change, as the constabulary now is educated and well-informed. To be able to adopt â€œsmart border managementâ€ practices they should be encouraged to come up with innovative ideas and adequate training in use of technical gadgets introduced in the force. The training philosophy also needs to orient itself with the present day operational environment. While western borders need aggressive domination and â€œEk goli ek dushmanâ€ type of training is still relevant, the eastern borders require troops to exercise restraint. This must therefore be incorporated in the basic induction training, and also when troops get deployed in those areas. Frequent deployment in counter-insurgency operations also necessitates incorporation of these aspects in the training. As mentioned above, border guarding is rapidly transforming into integrated border management where several agencies are equal stake holders. Borders will, in the near future, transform from barriers to bridges between nations. A smart border man therefore has to be aware of the developing scenario and understand the functioning of different agencies involved with the functioning of â€œintegrated check postsâ€ and â€œland custom stationsâ€ to facilitate the hassle-free movement of personnel and goods across the borders. Trained in policing duties, they are unable to come to grips with the complexities a large organisation like the BSF, and the dynamics of border management. The government has to give a serious thought and rectify this anomalous situation by handing over the baton to cadre officers, who, over the years, have acquired enough experience and maturity to take up the responsibility.

28-11-2018,Amandeep Sandhu,"Keeping his promise, Pakistan premier Imran Khan on Wednesday, 28 November, performed the ground-breaking ceremony for the proposed Kartarpur Sahib corridor. On Monday, 26 November, Indian Vice President Venkaiah Naidu and Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh laid the foundation stone at the Indian side at Dera Baba Nanak, three kilometers from the Gurdwara where Guru Nanak spent the last 17 years of his life. If this project reaches fruition by next November, the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak, it could mark a seachange in relations between arch rivals India and Pakistan. It could also set a precedent for the role religion can play to bring peace among erstwhile enemy nations and become a clarion call for peace in South Asia. Perhaps the most common critique of all religions is Karl Marx's phrase: opiate of the masses. The fact is that this phrase follows a longer sentence in which Marx describes the value of religion in human society. â€œReligion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opiate of the people.â€ Since Marxâ€™s utterance, while bashing religion, we often forget the value of religion and pick only its negative consequences. There are good reasons for it. There are umpteen examples of how communalism spreads, how politicians use religion to divide society, how competitive one-upmanship leads to violence, pogroms, riots and sectarianism. The Partition of India and Pakistan is considered the greatest exile in human history. It caused one million deaths and 14 million displacements. Ordinary people turned looters and plunderers. Even neighbours turned against each other â€“ all in the name of religion. For the Hindu and Muslim populations, the Partition caused loss of a sense of belonging to their birth and natural environments and devastated their economies. For the Sikhs, who opposed Partition, the event also caused separation from some of their most significant religious places, including the place of birth and passing away of their founder, Guru Nanak. The Sikhs prayers include the  performed in the presence of the  or for various small and big ceremonies. The  has three parts. The first and third part are fixed but the second part can be changed to suit the occasion. After 1947, the Sikhs included the following text in the second part of their  : â€œ â€ entres of religion, from which we have been separated.â€ For 71 years now, in spite of how New Delhi and Islamabad define the relationship between India and Pakistan, the Sikhs have been making the prayer to unite with their Gurdwaras. The developments this week seemed impossible just three months ago when Punjab Minister Navjot Singh Sidhu visited Pakistan and hugged their Army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa, who had proposed the corridor. The nationalist television studios, ruling Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP), called him a â€˜traitorâ€™. Sidhu was abused and mocked. Today, the same Indian government is supporting the corridor. The BJP, which has made â€˜hate Pakistanâ€™ its major agenda, would have never agreed for such a project, but came in to glorify its beleaguered alliance partner Shiromani Akali Dal. The cynical propaganda against the corridor shows how far the national narrative is from both east and west Punjab whose people share language, culture, deep bonds and have always aspired for peace. The national discourse does not get a simple fact: when two Punjabis meet, they hug as a way of greeting each other. It does not get it that former cricket stalwarts Imran Khan and Navjot Sidhu seek to re-write history. Guru Nanak says: â€œ â€ â€œIf you yearn to play love/enter with your head on your palm.â€ It is that moment for India and Pakistan. The call is whether we â€“ both nations â€“ want to play love, in this context with our neighbour. To fall apart, the proposal just needs: The Kartarpur Sahib Gurdwara was freely accessible until the 1960s. In the early 2000s, Pakistan made an attempt to open access, but was thwarted by the Indian government. The SAD was in power, and SGPC was in control. That is why, since then, people have been having the   through binoculars at the Border Security Force post at Dera Baba Nanak. It is set to change now. If this project succeeds, it may lead to access to other 194 Gurdwaras included in the Sikh Ardas. It may lead to better trade and cultural ties between the two Punjabs and nations. Most of all, it would lead to demilitarisation of two poverty-stricken nations and better spending on education, health-care and employment. Certainly those are what people of both nations seek from their governments. It is a razorâ€™s edge. As we say in Punjab:      (What does the first-time woman voter want?

30-11-2018,The News Minute,"Telangana caretaker IT Minister KT Rama Rao on Thursday, 29 November, lashed out at Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister and Telugu Desam Party (TDP) supremo N Chandrababu Naidu and questioned his decision to give Nandamuri Suhasini, the granddaughter of former CM NT Rama Rao, a â€˜losingâ€™ ticket like Kukatpally for the upcoming polls in the state. Continuing to take a jibe at Naidu, KTR asked if the TDP chief would have made Lokesh contest from Kukatpally. â€œHe did not, because he knows that Kukatpally is a losing seat. Naidu wants to make Suhasini a scapegoat and later wants to restrict her brothers (Jr NTR and Nandamuri Kalyan Ram) from entering into politics,â€ he said.

Suhasini is the candidate for the Peopleâ€™s Front alliance comprising the Congress, TDP, Telangana Jana Samithi (TJS) and CPI. KTR also said that the TRS had been in an alliance with the TDP in the past only because the latter assured support for the separate state of Telangana. â€œNaidu is asking why he is being criticised.

28-11-2018,David Devadas,"The Centre is in a stew over the recent fiasco regarding government formation in Jammu and Kashmir. Well-informed sources say there has been much criticism within the government, even at the highest level, of the way things have been handled. Home Minister Rajnath Singh and some in the national security establishment are said to be most displeased. Governor Satya Pal Malik, who is in the eye of the storm, even said on Wednesday, 28 November, that he might be transferred. If that indeed happens, it would be the result of his frequent public statements. Malikâ€™s stating that the Centre wanted him to install Sajjad Lone as the chief minister, has been damaging to both Lone and those in charge at the Centre. Associates of Lone, whose Peopleâ€™s Conference party has two MLAs in the house, have even said that this could get him killed. BJP General Secretary Ram Madhav is the putative strategist who seems to have miscalculated. It was his plan that there should be a period of governorâ€™s rule in J&K, during which the stateâ€™s administration should be cleaned up, and then a government of his choice would be installed. Amid the heartburn and criticism within the government over the past few days, top leaders have apparently made it clear that they were not party to some of the more sordid aspects of what has transpired. For instance, Mufti has alleged that central agencies such as the NIA have been misused to coerce MLAs. Loneâ€™s associates have been very hopeful that he would be installed with the support of the BJPâ€™s 25 MLAs and breakaway groups from the PDP, the Congress, and the National Conference. Their hopes were on a roller-coaster since July, but remained intact until last week. Their plans were overturned by the surprise move by three of the four substantial parties in the house (the other being the BJP) to form a government together. The move, which had been in the works over the previous few days, became public last Wednesday, 21 November. The house was dissolved that evening. Given the unseemly haste, it is unlikely that anyone focussed on the fact that the proposed alliance of three major parties would have been just short of two-thirds majority in the house. But the fact is that, with the help of a couple of single members, they could have attempted to amend the stateâ€™s constitution. On the other hand, the claim by the three parties acting in tandem could not be faulted. Yet, the governor initially described it as an â€˜unholy allianceâ€™. Pointing out that no formal claim had reached him, he asserted that he had played fair by not inviting either group. The three parties had come together after initial discussions at a meeting in London. The idea gathered steam even though NC leader Omar Abdullah was initially unhappy. Naturally! His party is set to gain from the general disappointment with the PDPâ€™s governance in Kashmir. No wonder Omar has called for fresh elections since the day the BJP withdrew support to the PDP-led government in July.   (What does the first-time woman voter want?

The protest, which will go on for two weeks will see party members from each of the 14 districts coming to the Secretariat to protest each day. Some of the demands that BJP will be putting forth during the protest will include lifting of restrictions in Sabarimala and strict action against the police officers for allegedly foisting false case on K Surendran, the general secretary of the party. The BJP state president said that the decision to shift the protest from Sabarimala to the Secretariat comes after women between ages 10 and 50 have stopped attempting to enter the shrine. â€œOnly if women between these ages try to enter the temple, will we begin protesting at Sabarimala again. Now that some of the restrictions are lifted, we will receive backlash from the devotees (if protests inconvenience them),â€ said Sreedharan Pillai. Reacting to this, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that he welcomes the BJPâ€™s decision to shift their protests to the Secretariat. â€œThis decision by the BJP shows they have understood that the people have started to grasp the stand of the state government regarding the Sabarimala issue,â€ said Pinarayi Vijayan. â€œIt is not possible to stand straight if you take a stand that is not acceptable by the society,â€ said the CM.

30-11-2018,Neeraj Gupta,"According to latest figures of electoral bonds that have surfaced, out of the bonds worth Rs 222 crore between 1 March to 10 March 2018, Rs 210 croreâ€™s worth of donations have been given to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is 95 percent of the total bonds. Is this a mere coincidence or there is something else going on here? Hereâ€™s a little philosophy around electoral bonds: On 1 February 2018, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley declared that the donations received by political parties henceforth will not be in cash, but in the form of electoral bonds. However, the details of the donor and the receiver of this bond will be confidential. It's commonly believed that the party predicted to win the elections receives the maximum funds, in anticipation of the benefits that will accrue once the party gains power. This is the very basis of the corruption that takes place in government. An   by  â€™s Poonam Agarwal revealed that electoral bonds have a hidden alphanumeric code printed on them to track down the link between donors and political parties. This apparent manoeuvring by the government poses a critical question â€“ in the name of increased â€˜transparencyâ€™ in political funding with the introduction of electoral bonds, are we being subjected to unprecedented levels of secret surveillance? Electoral bonds were promised to be anonymous as no one other than the donors themselves are supposed to know which political party they are contributing to. â€™s investigation reveals that while the public will remain clueless about who has donated to which party, the government has access to those details, collated through alphanumeric codes on the electoral bonds, which are invisible to the naked eye. This adds to the governmentâ€™s already burgeoning repository of data, which now may not only have details of our bank accounts and financial transactions, but also our likely political preferences.

Talking to PTI while campaigning in the rural areas of Tonk, Khan said the decision to field him was based on strategy and equations, and not on his religion. Asked about being the lone Muslim candidate of the BJP and if his nomination marked a departure from the party's strategy to not field any candidates from the minority community, he said: ""I don't know about elsewhere, but in Rajasthan, Yoonus Khan and (late BJP leader) Ramzan Khan have been fighting polls since the 80s."" Khan said he has been the party's lone Muslim candidate once earlier also. Asked if Tonk having a large number of Muslims was one of the reasons behind his candidature, the BJP leader said the election here will be on the basis of performance and agenda. ""The election will be on who can serve Tonk better. I have given my vision... As a minister I connected Sawai Madhopur road to a two-lane road. I have given a bypass.â€, he said. He also vowed to solve the problem of drinking water faced by the residents of Tonk.

The   in   possession alleges that Chomwal has been wrongly accused in the case and has been made an â€œescape goatâ€ (sic) especially when the petitioner (ie: Chomwal) helped Vijay Shekhar and his brother in apprehending the three â€˜culpritsâ€™. The police has not clarified what evidence they have against Sonia, Roopak and Devinder to prove their involvement in the case. Is Chomwal so foolish that he will agree on the transfer of the ransom money to his bank account which can act as an evidence against him in the court? The FIR reveals that the first ransom call was made by Chomwal on 20 September but the complaint was filed on 22 October. Why did the complainant wait for 32 days to file a complaint? Why did Vijay and his brother transfer Rs 2 lakh to Chomwalâ€™s bank account and then file a complaint? Was it to create evidence? Well, the FIR says that they already had Chomwalâ€™s WhatsApp calls and messages as evidence. Soniaâ€™s lawyer said that she was regularly attending office between 20 September and 22 October, during the period when Chomwal was blackmailing Vijay. Her lawyer claimed that there would be enough evidence in the form of CCTV footage to prove her presence in the office. The question then is â€“ why was she allowed to come to office when Vijay knew that she was one of the persons blackmailing him? (What does the first-time woman voter want?

30-11-2018,Vikrant Dubey ," Mohd Ibrahim Fabeha Syed Sadhus of Ayodhya have expressed their disappointment over the â€˜Dharm-Sabhaâ€™ organised by the VHP on 25 November in Ayodhya. They accuse BJP of not doing enough for the construction of Ram Mandir. Most sadhus and priests of Ayodhya distanced themselves from the â€˜sabhaâ€™. They said that they were not invited to the event because they are speaking out vociferously on the temple issue, and the BJP does not like that. Priests feel that the BJP likes to consult religious leaders so it can keep the issue of Ram Mandir burning just to maintain a hold on the larger public sentiment. One of the priests also threatened to end his life if the construction date of Ram Mandir is not announced soon. People of Ayodhya also complained that they feel the Ram Mandir issue will not be getting resolved anytime soon. Some of the locals who   spoke to, said that the BJP always promised constructing the Ram Temple on the condition that they are elected to power, but when they win, nothing happens.

The CJI appreciated Justice Joseph's contribution saying he was a good judge and that the court needs his replacement. However, Justice Gogoi said young lawyers are not willing to become judges. He said young lawyers are ready to make sacrifices and do hard work. He urged bar associations to help in encouraging lawyers to join judiciary.

Justice Joseph said that judges must have compassion as without compassion, there is no point in interpreting laws. He pointed out that many litigations came in the form of public interest, which results in wastage of time of courts.

29-11-2018,Abhipsha Mahapatro,"Thereâ€™s an agrarian crisis gripping our country and pushing the hands that feed us to commit suicide, says senior journalist P Sainath. There has never been an urgent need to address this crisis more than now, and the hundreds of countryâ€™s farmers want the parliamentarians to listen, he points out. Sainath, a renowned journalist known for his ground reports that focus on the plight of the farmers, has been participating in protest marches organised by the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC). â€œThe message behind this march is that people expect Parliament to work for the people and not just for the corporate world. When a special session of Parliament can be called for the rollout of GST, with virtually no notice, then why canâ€™t one be called for the farmersâ€™ issues,â€ he asks. He says that the first Swaminathan commission report was submitted in 2004 â€“ and the last in 2006 â€“ which means that â€œin 14 years, Parliament has not found the time to discuss the report.â€ We also need to discuss the water crisis in the country, which is not just limited to droughts, he added. â€œSenseless utilisation of resources is taking place. There are massive transfers of water from agriculture to industry, from village to the city, from food crop to cash crop, etc,â€ Sainath says. Sainath says that there is also a need to engage with, and uphold the rights and needs of those who do the greatest amount of work in agriculture: The women farmers â€“ both landed and landless. He said that another major differentiation of this protest was how seriously â€œthe middle class is now taking the issues of farmers, after almost 20 years of indifference.â€ â€œBe it Mumbai, Nashik or Delhi... doctors, teachers, and students from universities all over the country have come out in support of the farmers,â€ he says.

Data from the   submitted by the BJP to the Election Commission of India (ECI) further substantiates this assumption. BJP was the beneficiary of 95 percent of the electoral bonds purchased in 2017-18. The electoral bonds scheme was notified in January 2018. March 2018 was the   when these bonds were available for purchase from four different branches of SBI (Chennai, Kolkata, Mumbai & New Delhi).  using the Right to Information (RTI) revealed that a total of 520 electoral bonds worth Rs 222 crore were purchased in March 2018. Hence in the year 2017-18, these were the only bonds that were purchased. Most bonds (in terms of number) were purchased in Kolkata where 212 bonds were purchased. In terms of value, most bonds (worth Rs 122 crore) were purchased in Mumbai. As per the   submitted by the BJP to the ECI, the party received Rs 210 crore worth contribution in the form of electoral bonds.Â  This is a whopping 95 percent of all the electoral bonds purchased in 2017-18. Since the design of the scheme does not allow for the disclosure of names of the contributors, it is impossible to find out who contributed these Rs 210 crore to the BJP. Out of the total voluntary contribution of Rs 989.7 crore received by the BJP in 2017-18, more than 21 percent or Rs 210 crore is through electoral bonds. Even in terms of the total income of the BJP in 2017-18, more than 20 percent is through electoral bonds. 45 percent of BJPâ€™s income in 2016-17 was from unknown sources as per  . This would further increase in 2017-18 because of the anonymous nature of electoral bonds. None of the national or state parties that have   their annual audit report for 2017-18 have declared any income from electoral bonds. It also has to be noted that the Congress and NCP are the only two national parties that are yet to submit their annual audit report for 2017-18. It is possible that the rest of Rs 12 crore worth electoral bonds have gone to either the Congress or NCP or other state parties. It is also possible that a large part of these electoral bonds may not have gone to any party since   using RTI also revealed that bonds worth Rs 11 crore were not encashed by July 2018.  purchased in all the cycles till October 2018 clearly indicates that there is no demand for bonds of lower denomination. In terms of value, bonds of Rs 1 crore denomination accounted for Rs 782 crore or 89.6 percent followed by bonds of Rs 10 lakh denomination that accounted for Rs 89.6 crore or 10.3 percent. Together, they have accounted for close to 99.9 percent of total value of bonds purchased till date. Even in terms of the number of bonds purchased, 1678 out of the 1795 or 93.5 percent electoral bonds purchased till date are in the denomination of Rs 10 lakh and Rs 1 crore. Though there is no concrete information on the type of purchasers since SBI has refused to share such information, it is highly likely that the Rs 10 lakh and Rs 1 crore denomination are purchased by corporates than individuals.

29-11-2018,Tridivesh Singh Maini,"Tensions between cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu and Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh came to the fore, when the latter, in an interview to a TV channel stated, that he had advised Sidhu to   his decision to attend the foundation stone ceremony of the Kartarpur Corridor on 28 November 2018, in Pakistan. Singh said that Sidhu did not get back to him on the matter. Earlier in August 2018, when the Punjab Minister hugged Pakistani Army Chief General Bajwa, on the sidelines of Pakistani PM Imran Khanâ€™s swearing in, it created a furore, and the Punjab CM criticised Sidhu. The Punjab CM stated, that at a time when the Pakistan Army was killing Indian soldiers, Sidhuâ€™s hug was uncalled for. Sidhu who left the BJP due to his strained ties with the Badal family has been far more aggressive on Sukhbir Singh Badal, President of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD, an ally of the BJP) and his brother-in-law Bikramjit Singh Majithia, a former Minister in the erstwhile SAD government. Sidhu sought the arrest of Majithia for his alleged links with drug peddlers (the Punjab minister stated that a special task force report set up by the Congress government had sufficient evidence, which pointed to Majithiaâ€™s involvement in drug peddling). The Punjab CM, who in his previous tenure went hammer and tongs against the Badals, has been less combative, with many, including his own party men, alleging that he has a tacit understanding with the Badals. Even when the Ranjit Singh Commission report (set up by Captain Amarinder Singh to investigate the sacrilege of the Guru Granth Sahib in 2015, as well as the death of two peaceful protesters who died as a result of police firing) was tabled in the Punjab assembly, Sidhu took a far stronger line against the Badals, arguing that the report stated that the former CM Parkash Singh Badal had issued firing orders. Captain Amarinder is being hailed for his decision to decline the Pakistani invitation for attending the foundation stone ceremony of the Kartarpur Sahib. Captain Singh has cited terrorism emanating from Pakistan, as well as the role of the Pakistani Army in the same as the reason for his decision. Elahiâ€™s family is known for his proximity to the Pakistan Army as well as the ISI. Captain Singh visited Pakistan in 2005 and held the all Punjab games in December 2004. Significantly, during the 1980â€™s, the Elahiâ€™s had links with a number of Khalistani activists and some analysts had criticised Captain Singh for going overboard in his outreach to Pakistani Punjab inspite of the above factors. Captain Amarinder Singh during his Pakistan visits has also cultivated strong personal friendships with individuals known to have close links with the Pakistani â€˜Deep Stateâ€™. The reasons for Captain Amarinder Singhâ€™s decision to decline the Pakistani invitation thus are not driven solely by any principles or conviction. While Captain Singhâ€™s decision and aggressive statements do no harm to burnish his nationalist credentials and his tough stance when it comes to national security, it is a bit naive to overlook other factors for Singhâ€™s latest moves. One important factor could be that Navjot Singh Sidhu has stolen the limelight in the context of the Kartarpur issue.     (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Speaking to the media upon her return from the Kartarpur Corridor ceremony, Badal, who is in-charge of the Food Processing Industries portfolio, said: Badalâ€™s remark comes after Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said that Sidhu would win elections if he contested in Pakistan. Khan also questioned why Sidhu had been criticised in India for attending his oath-taking ceremony in August.

26-11-2018,A K Singh,"The pristine Andaman and Nicobar islands lie in splendid isolation over 750 kms in the Bay of Bengal, and have a chequered history. After lying unclaimed for centuries, they were colonized by the British for over 150 years and briefly by the Japanese during World War II. They are intricately linked with the forests they live in and have limited, or in some cases, no contact at all with the outside world. Most of them live as hunter-gatherers and prefer to remain in seclusion. Between 2013 and 2016, I faced many challenges living here, as administrator of the islands. Having toured the islands extensively, and interacted with all shades of opinion, I came to the conclusion that there are 4 centres of gravity in these islands viz strategic security; the settlers and their development aspirations; the indigenous tribes and their right to live in the manner they wish to in the protected space reserved for them; and of course, the pristine environment. These 4 centres of gravity have to live in harmony, and not at the expense of each other. This articulation became necessary ad helpful to place the narrative in a balanced perspective. There are strong views on both ends of the spectrum: one view is that we should leave the tribals alone, backed by strong evidence that any contact with modernisation has been deterimental to the primitive tribes. At the other end of the spectrum, there is an equally strong view to mainstream the tribals â€“ why deny them the fruits of modernisation, they ask. We were surprised: the Jarawas wanted selective interaction. There are over 400 Jarawas living in the Jarawa tribal reserve, measuring 1000 sq kms, in south and middle Andaman Islands. The tribe was once feared for their hostility, but over the years have become less so. The Andaman Trunk Road, a national highway that cuts through the tribal reserve , has given rise to allegations of â€˜tribal tourismâ€™ by many NGOs who even went to the extent of calling for a tourism boycott of the islands. This accusation was not entirely true, though there have been sporadic cases, including unlawful acts committed by the settlers who live in the vicinity of the reserved areas. As per a Supreme Court directive, an alternate sea route has also become functional. Violations of the primitive tribe regulations ANPATR-1956 are viewed very seriously, though convictions in the courts have been tardy. In our endeavour to interact with them, seven-eight hotspots were designated for interactions to take place. Women would get their children on designated days, and a bilingual script based on their own â€˜Onganâ€™ language was taught. A very rudimentary barter system was also initiated to preserve their dignity. To our surprise, the women requested for clothes; basic clothing was provided, which the women wore only when crossing the road. We also set up an â€œAndaman Nicobar Tribal Research Institute â€“ ANTRIâ€ in 2014, where research and study programmes provide valuable data for creating informed policies. In fact, some of the Nicobar elders were very enthused, as they believed that their heritage, culture, customs, language and traditions needed to be preserved for future generations. Untill 1993, the administration tried to befriend the Sentinelese, but their efforts were in vain. With effect from 1993, the approved policy was changed to â€œhands offâ€ to respect the will of the Sentinelese. This meant that we could undertake periodical helicopter reconnaissances, and also circumnavigation by sea. A number of poachers were apprehended near the island, vindicating our change of policy. While a case of murder may have been registered against unknown people, the law will be difficult to apply against people who do not understand it, live in a different world, and who only acted to defend themselves against illegal intrusion. A similar dilemma occurred with respect to the Jarawas. Once a report came in that Jarawa men had killed a 5-month-old-child whom they suspected of being born of illicit relations between a settler and a Jarawa woman. While the settler was arrested, we did not have clarity with reference to the Jarawa, who were actually very open about it. Such cases have to be dealt with very sensitively, keeping in view the fact that the isolated tribes do not understand the law and live by their own customs. As per available information, the government has removed â€˜Restricted Area Permitâ€™ from 29 islands upto 2022, including islands whichÂ  are inhabited by PVTGs, 3 islands in South Andaman and 9 islands in Nicobar district. This has caused dismay and alarm amongst many who are concerned about the well being of the tribals. It obviously appears to be with an aim to mainstream the tribals, as also to boost tourism, albeit, without due diligence about the effects and in contravention of ANPATR-1956. It cannot be anyoneâ€™s case that Nicobar islands must remain restricted forever. But opening it should be a gradual process and with the consent of the tribal council. In fact in my tenure, we had started this dialogue with the tribal captains and there was a mixed response. It would be wise to move forward slowly and with sensitivity. Such decisions cannot be based on a notion to turn these islands into another Phuket or Macao. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you. "
29-11-2018,Avi Singh,"The recent demand, forcefully made by the RSS Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat, for a law or ordinance on the Ram temple, pushes a false binary â€“ between a judicial decision and an ordinance or act. This is a curious call to action because, hopefully, the BJP and RSS know that no law can bypass the Constitution or judicial challenges in courts. And this law in particular â€“ assuming the ruling party will have it passed in both houses of the Parliament â€“ will most certainly be challenged in the Supreme Court. Unless the government seeks to build religious centres for all communities â€“which, given the political and ideological proclivities of the ruling dispensation, is unimaginable â€“ the law to not only acquire the disputed land for a temple, but also to build it, would run into the headwinds of the constitutional guarantee of  . Gandhi and Sardar Patel supported the reconstruction of the Somnath temple, but not by the government and not by using state funds, despite the fact that the Somnath temple was not disputed in the way the Ram temple is. Secularism of the Indian state approximates more to proximity to all religions, rather than equal distance from all. The state is involved with a number of existing religious practices and institutions, but to pass a law that not only favours the faith of one community over another, but also legitimises retrospectively the assault committed on the faith of a minority community by the destruction of the Babri Masjid, would be to go too far beyond any possible definition of a secular state. We have been here before. The last time the government sought to acquire the land to settle the dispute between territories through the Acquisition of Central Area of Ayodhya Act, 1993, it took the matter (itself) to the Supreme Court in a reference, and declared before it, that it was committed â€œto the construction of a Ram temple and a mosqueâ€, without specifying exact locations. The matter, at the heart of it, is a land dispute â€“ a fact that is easy to forget in the political and ideological heat that surrounds it. (It is pertinent to remember that what was destroyed on 6 December 1992 was not only the Babri Masjid, but also the Ram Chabutra and Kaushalya Rasoi, whose existence is historically parallel to the Babri Mosque.) In  , the Supreme Court struck down the aforementioned 1993 Act saying that it was unconstitutional, as it overrode the property rights of the Muslim litigants, acquired according to the latterâ€™s pleadings, through the simple fact that the Babri Masjid had stood on the disputed land at least since the 16th century. In addition, the government would also have to demonstrate that any such acquisition is in public interest â€“ not an easy task, given that acquiring the land to build a Ram temple would favour one religion over another. If the government were to pass another such Act (this time with no proposal to build a mosque, presumably) it will also have to contend with the Places of Worship Act (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, which bars the conversion of any place of worship, including of course a mosque, as it existed on independence â€“ a fairly fundamental safeguard for a secular state. Until that date, around when Muslims were forcibly stopped from using the mosque, Babri Masjid was a place of worship for the latter, barring the Ram Chabutra, which of course was a Hindu place of worship. It  also easy to forget that there is a criminal case winding its way through the judicial system given that it has been progressing at a pace that would put glaciers to shame. A law of the nature demanded by senior RSS leaders would only further abuse that the trust, and provide state approval and sanction to the demolition. If it comes into force, then the Supreme Court will have to answer if a criminal act can create property and other rights. Given the context, and our institutional and constitutional structure, it is baffling that the RSS is pushing the government to come up with a law to bypass the judiciary. The worst they can do is to keep mounting all kinds of pressure on the judiciary â€“ including, for instance, the sort of vitriolic and personalised attack that Indresh Kumar launched on â€˜2-3â€™ judges in a speech that he delivered on 27 November â€“ and hope that the courts will buckle under pressure. But they cannot stop the law they are demanding from being brought to the courts, and challenged. Further delay means that the issue will remain emotive and eminently exploitable for elections to come but if the RSSâ€™s real intent is to see a Ram temple built on the disputed land, a law passed by the government cannot help them bypass the judiciary. The only way to bypass the judiciary at first pass is to build the temple illegally, and the only way to bypass it altogether, is to change the Constitution to suit their end goal.

29-11-2018,Nishtha Gautam,"â€œMy book doesnâ€™t seek to say that this person or this dispensation ruined everything because, frankly, everyone is collectively responsible for the rural distress there is today in the country.â€ â€œIâ€™m a member of the Parliament and I decided long back not to draw a parliamentary salary. I donated it to those families of the farmers that committed suicide. While that went on for a number of years, I realised that the number of people I was benefitting was very small in proportion to the amount of distress there was. So I felt like, why not start a political movement! Something on a larger scale. Now, with the help of the district administration in UP, we identified such farmers and started crowd-funding in those areas. We worked with around 4,300 farmers across districts like Allahabad, Balrampur, Bijnor, Lakhimpur-Khiri. We were very particular about keeping the rate of recidivism low. It should not be like that a person takes the money, reduces or eliminates his debt, and goes on to spend it on his daughterâ€™s marriage and gets back into debt again. This movement gave me a sense that we could see things to their logical conclusion. But again, this scale was very small. I realised that to effect a social transformation, we need to change things at the policy level because thatâ€™s the only way things are going to be systemically solved. Thatâ€™s when I started working on this book. This book has taken me to 11 states, 60 districts to talk about things like water, labour, textile, energy access, agricultural marketing etc.â€ â€œYou always find a very urban bias towards the fact that the farmer loan waivers have been given. If you look at total farm loan waivers in the country versus industry subsidies, the total farm loan waivers today are exactly 3.6% of the industry subsidies. When we are talking about people who are 70% of the total population, just 3.6%! So exactly which sops are we talking about? The conversation on agriculture these days is almost as if we are doing the farmers a favour, which is completely the other way round. A farmer doing a hectare of paddy or wheat farming earns about Rs 2,500-2,800 per month from that. An agricultural labourer earns about 5000 rupees a month. So a farmer is doing worse than the labour working on his field. How can it be sustainable? No wonder 30 million people in the last five years have left agriculture. 50 million people before that in the last ten years. Thatâ€™s a lot of people. If it continues down this road, our food security will be threatened. My point is not simply about agriculture. My study is an academic critique of how the village as an economic unit can be viable a 100 years from now. Because if the village doesnâ€™t remain viable then frankly India as a country is going to collapse. The cities cannot bear the burden of internal migration. We need to look at non-farm income, we need to look at textile, handicrafts. India has over 300 handicraft clusters. Why are we not ramping those up? In India one sustainable job in steel costs 24 lakh rupees; 24 jobs are created in textile for 1 lakh rupees. As a country, which one should we be looking at? We have an army of unemployed people, what are we doing?â€ â€œWhen Bombay Presidency was created, the British focused on irrigation in the southern Bombay Presidency, which is the present day Gujarat, and in western Maharashtra of today. But they did very little in what is now Vidarbha because it was largely seen as jungle. Now look at the consequence of something as basic as irrigation. The farmers of Vidarbha have 4% irrigation and they have been reduced to total pauperisation and this region sees the largest rate of farmer suicides in the country. The problems are there but the solutions are not terribly difficult.â€ â€œItâ€™s not about the government only. Itâ€™s also about the channels in the middle. There is a historical study done in 1972 in then Calcutta, which said that just 2% of the end-user price of an orange reached the farmer because the marketing channels had consumed the majority of the value. Just look at our APMCs, the mandis. Unpaved roads, open spaces. Even today there are no storage facilities, there is no cover. A lot of stuff gets rotten. When you go there itâ€™s almost like a mafia is running it. The farmers are at their mercy. The farmer goes there from his village 7-8 km away in a tractor trolley. Sometimes he stays there for 3-4 days awaiting good price. And then in desperation he sells at whatever price. Even if we do nothing else and just fix the mandis in our country that itself will alleviate and mitigate a lot of farmer distress. â€œThese are very good solutions. Communication and information revolution will help the farmer. The point is, however, how many farmers have the smartphone? Even if they have smartphones they have cheap ones that donâ€™t have enough battery power to run them. The electricity situation is not the best so their phones are not charged half the time. One of the projects that I undertook in Banda was with a group that was doing a lot of great work with information disseminated from Mandya in Karnataka via the mobile. Initially we took 4 villages in Banda and we started sharing this with them and we found that they were resistant. They said, â€œ â€ But when I visited again after three months they were literally looking at their phones for one hour a day to educate themselves. Digital solutions will certainly work but please remember that in India we have gone from medievalism to post-modernism in a record period of time. So, we are living in, simultaneously, two different time zones.â€ â€œWhen talking about dairy, my mother takes the animal rights approach and I see it from purely economic perspective. Now a person engaged in dairy farming will eventually take the animal to the slaughterhouse after its milch phase is over because they canâ€™t afford to keep them. What we need to look at is different systems to keep those creatures relevant for the farmer. In India, we have a desperate need for energy. When LPG cylindersâ€”which are made from crude oilâ€”spike in price they become unaffordable for the last man in society. So, if we can look at gobar gas plants many of our issues are solved. A bovine creature gives about 30-40 kgs of gobar everyday. If we can build localised gobar gas plants in every village and connect them to every house weâ€™d have increased electricity, the tyranny of distance would be less and it would be cheaper. And those animals would always be relevant and therefore lead the life of some dignity.â€ (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you. "

27-11-2018,Siddharth Chatterjee ,"â€˜Do not let us off the hook; keep our feet to the fireâ€™. These were the words of the   when he promised to personally lead the global body towards greater gender equality. As the world observes the start of â€˜16 Days of Activismâ€™ against gender-based violence (from 26 November 2018), an independent United Nations system-wide survey on sexual harassment is taking place around all UN country offices. It is the first of its kind, and it demonstrates the UNâ€™s resolve to eradicate sexual harassment and ensure a safe and inclusive workplace for all personnel across its offices. The UN initiative is in lock-step with the theme for this yearâ€™s â€˜16 Days of Activismâ€™ â€“ â€˜Orange the World; Hear Me Tooâ€™. The aim is to raise awareness about violence against women and its impact on a womanâ€™s physical, psychological, social and spiritual well-being. The #MeToo movement heralded the coming out of women across various professions and work forces, against their (primarily) male perpetrators, breaking a decades-old silence that they were previously compelled to live with. Statistics indicate that more than one in three women across the world have experienced physical or sexual violence, usually perpetrated by an intimate partner. In a   by Edison Research and Marketplace on sexual harassment, 27 percent of women and 14 percent of men reported that they had been harassed at some time at their workplace. Despite the progressive policy commitments and institutional frameworks on gender equality and women empowerment, implementation remains slow and inconsistent. While the   campaign has gained high momentum since its launch in September 2014, a lot still needs to be done to bring men on board in addressing sexual harassment towards women in public and private spaces. Such campaigns have brought considerable gains towards raising consciousness and self-assurance for women. Increasingly, they are speaking out against the indignities of work-related sexual advances and intimidation. This is the cost that countries are paying when women and girls are denied the chance to live to their full social and economic potential. Consider the aspect of employment: according to a World Bank   released this year, countries are losing USD 160 trillion in wealth because of differences in lifetime earnings between women and men. This amounts to an average of USD 23,620 for each person. In India, reports indicate that every 4 in 10 women have experienced some form of domestic violence. In a country where physical and psychological abuse is all pervasive and rampant, the Sexual Harassment of Women at the Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 has done little to alleviate gender-based discrimination and violence. The Act requires an employer to set up an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) at each office that has more than 10 employees of any gender. However, a   done some years back found that 7 in 10 working women did not report workplace harassment, demonstrating a disturbing lack of confidence in the system. By one  , gender inequality may have reduced Indiaâ€™s economic growth by almost 4 percent annually over the past 10 years. . It is estimated that 27 percent of girls in India are married before their 18th birthday. It is said that the return on one year of secondary education for a girl correlates with as high as a 25 percent increase in wages. In addition, ensuring that all girls get at least secondary education in India, would reduce child marriages by more than half. All these demonstrate the cyclical benefits, from one generation to the next, of education as an intervention strategy. However, while evidence abounds that parity with women is the best driving force for economic growth, wealth creation and poverty eradication, womenâ€™s rights are being â€œreduced, restricted and reversedâ€, according to UN Secretary-General, Mr Guterres. There cannot be any illusions about the enormity of the task ahead. Misogyny is a deep-rooted expression of male entitlement that often excuses sexual harassment and violence, even at times by the survivors themselves. Women shouldn't have to feel 'grateful' for opportunities, says the UN DSG Amina Mohammed in a  . So true. Ultimately, countries need to begin breaking structural barriers, not just with gender equality as a lofty ideal but as a deliberate strategy for sustainable development. â€™s (What does the first-time woman voter want?

27-11-2018,Mithun MK,"Two days after she went missing from her residence on Tuesday morning, Chandramukhi Muvvala, a well-known trans activist who is contesting the Telangana polls from Goshamahal, was found on Wednesday night. This came a day after Chandramukhiâ€™s mother, Anitha Muvvala, represented by lawyer Vasudha Nagraj, filed a habeas corpus writ petition in the Hyderabad High Court. Admitting the petition, the court had asked the Jubilee Hills police to produce Chandramukhi before them by 10:15 am on Thursday. Chandramukhi had reportedly been missing since 8:25 am on Tuesday, 27 November; based on the missing person's complaint, an FIR has been filed. The police said that they are reviewing CCTV footage. According to sources, Chandramukhi turned up at the Banjara Hills police station along with her lawyer and some activists late on Wednesday night. Speaking to TNM, Anitha confirmed that Chandramukhi had been found and was doing okay. She is expected to be produced at the court at 10 am. ""She has come back. She was abducted by someone and intimidated severely, she's dazed and disoriented. She'll share what happened to her before the court,"" Vasudha Nagaraj, her lawyer, told TNM. â€œShe was noticed missing since 8:25 am and the door of her house is locked from the outside,â€ the Banjara Hills SHO said. Chandramukhi, a well-known face in Hyderabadâ€™s trans community, is contesting from the Goshamahal constituency in Hyderabad on a Bahujan Left Front (BLF) ticket. She will be taking on bigwigs such as the BJPâ€™s Raja Singh and the Congressâ€™ Mukesh Goud.
